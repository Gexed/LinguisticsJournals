Installation Instructions for PC:
		Just place:
			1. the .XSL files you need, and types.xml into the folder %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Bibliography\Style
			2. the BIBFORM.XML into the folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\1033\Bibliography then restart Microsoft Word to use the new citation and bibliography styles. (This will need to be reperformed if the desired "Type of Source" under "Insert Citation" is no longer there. That's because MS Word does update this file whenever it detects a change to it.)
            
Installation Instructions for Mac (provided by griffraff):
            1. right-click on Microsoft Word 2008 and select show package contents. Put the files in: Contents/Resources/Style/ On most Macs with Microsoft Word 2008 this will be: /Applications/Microsoft Office 2008/Microsoft Word.app/Contents/Resources/Style/
            2. For the Biblo file (that goes in 1033), followed this: Word templates are stored in your user Library folder, which is hidden by default. To open it, hold down the Option/Alt key while clicking on the Go menu and choosing Library. Word 2011 templates are stored in ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/My Templates. Word 2019 templates are stored in ~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Templates.
