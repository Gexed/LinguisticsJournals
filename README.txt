Installation Instructions:
		Just place:
			1. the .XSL files you need, and types.xml into the folder %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Bibliography\Style
			2. the BIBFORM.XML into the folder C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\1033\Bibliography
		then restart Microsoft Word to use the new citation and bibliography styles.
		
		If your style does not appear in Word, it means there is a syntax error in your file and you should try to find out what is wrong.
		
		Please feel free to email Dr. Locky Law if you find any bugs you want me to fix.
